## ArtExtract ðŸŽ¨ 

#### Project overview
The ArtExtract project leverages machine learning to revolutionize art conservation by uncovering hidden paintings through multispectral imaging. By creating a comprehensive dataset of multispectral images of paintings, the project aims to develop an AI model capable of detecting hidden artworks behind the canvas. The project's innovative techniques could lead to significant discoveries in art history. Initially, the focus is on generating high-quality multispectral images from RGB images, addressing the challenges and strategic approaches needed to achieve this goal.

#### Dataset

| Dataset  | Info | Info |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| CAVE  | 32 scenes with full spectral resolution reflectance data from 400nm to 700nm at 10nm intervals (31 bands total)  | [Link](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/databases/multispectral/)  |
| Harvard | 50 indoor and outdoor images, with 25 images featuring mixed illumination  | [Link](https://vision.seas.harvard.edu/hyperspec/d2x5g3/)  |

```
#### Implementation guidance

1) Install the required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2) Train the model 
```
<!-- Example -->
python train.py --trainpath  '../train/' --valpath '../val/' -lr 0.02 -e 100
```
#### Results
- Final results will be released by the final evaluation period.
